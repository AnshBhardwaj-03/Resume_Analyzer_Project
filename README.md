# Resume Analyzer Project

🟢I've built an AI-powered Resume Analyzer that helps users understand why resumes get rejected by ATS systems. Here's what it does:

It checks how well a resume matches a job description and highlights missing skills.

♦️ Why I built it:
-> Many resumes get rejected before a human sees them
-> Small keyword gaps can cost real opportunities

♦️ What it does:
-> Compares resume vs job description
-> Shows missing keywords
-> Gives basic improvement suggestions

♦️ Where tools like this are used:
-> ATS systems
-> HR tech platforms
-> Recruitment automation
